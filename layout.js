In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory's `fetch` within a layout or a component that's dynamically loaded.  The issue stems from how the `fetch` interacts with the rendering process and data fetching.  If the data isn't available when the layout renders, or if there's a race condition between the layout's render and the data fetch, it can lead to hydration mismatches or unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with concurrent requests or slow API responses.

```javascript
// pages/layout.js
'use client'

export default async function Layout({ children }) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  const data = await response.json();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data from API: {data.message}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code might fail to hydrate correctly if `/api/data` is slow to respond. The layout renders before the data is available, causing a mismatch between the server-side and client-side rendering.
